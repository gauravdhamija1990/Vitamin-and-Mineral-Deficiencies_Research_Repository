Abstract
Objective: To estimate the prevalence of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, and household consumption of adequately iodized salt in Damoh district, Madhya Pradesh in 2016.
Methods: Cross-sectional study with cluster sampling method was used among school-going children. 30 clusters, each with 90 children were selected to access Total Goiter rate (TGR). 540 salt samples were collected to estimate salt iodine content from their household and 270 on the spot urine samples were collected to estimate Urine Iodine Excretion level.
Results: TGR was 2.08%. The prevalence of iodine deficiency, adequate iodine nutrition, and either more than adequate or toxic level of Iodine was 26%, 28% and 46 %, respectively. 72.4% people were consuming adequately iodized salt.
Conclusion: Damoh district is no more an endemic area for iodine deficiency. We recommend continuous monitoring to assess IDDs as well Iodine-induced toxicity in future.
