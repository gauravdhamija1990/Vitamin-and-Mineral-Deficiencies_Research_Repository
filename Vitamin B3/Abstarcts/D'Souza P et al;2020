Title: A Comparative Study of the Nutrient Intake by Anaemic and Non-Anaemic Adolescent Girls (16-18 years)

Abstract: Malnutrition is an ever-growing health problem recognised in the present adolescents today. The present study was undertaken to assess the nutrient intake of Adolescent girls (16-18 years)  in Ajmer city and to make a comparative study of the Anaemic and Non Anaemic subjects. 

Method: Anthropometric measures, biochemical investigation to assess the Haemoglobin levels in the subjects, and dietary survey through 24-hour recall method for three consecutive days were measured from 250 subjects by using standard techniques. 

Results: On an average the subjects of anaemic groups consumed significantly less (P  <0.01) Energy, Protein, Iron, Vitamin A, Folic acid, Niacin, Ascorbic acid and Fibre. The non-anemic group had their nutrient intakes which were less than the Recommended Dietary  Allowances (RDA), but the intakes of almost all the nutrients were even lesser in the anaemic group than the ones in the Non Anaemic group.  The prevalence of anaemia in the girls of  adolescent age group might be related to dietary deficiencies and perhaps poor dietary patterns.  The present study undertaken indicated that those subjects who had deficient nutrient intake in their diet would have a higher risk of anaemia as compared to normal or overweight subjects.
