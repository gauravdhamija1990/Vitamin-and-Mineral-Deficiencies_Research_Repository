Title: Subclinical Vitamin D Deficiency in Children from Thrissur, Kerala

Abstract
This study was conducted to assess the 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels in children (age 1-5 yr) from Thrissur, Kerala, and to find its association with clinical manifestations of vitamin D-deficiency. Among the 79 children included, none had clinical features of rickets. The mean (range) vitamin D level was 18.1 (3.7 - 68.0) ng/mL. All the children had normal serum levels of Calcium, Phosphorous and Alkaline phosphatase. Serum parathyroid hormone levels were normal in 77 children. We conclude that most children with subclinical vitamin D deficiency diagnosed on basis of serum levels of 25 (0H) D do not have clinical symptoms/signs or biochemical evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
