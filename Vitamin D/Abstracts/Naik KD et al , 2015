Title
Cord Blood Vitamin D Levels of Term Neonates.

Abstract
We estimated cord blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels of 50 term healthy neonates born in a tertiary care center of Kozhikode, Kerala, India. Vitamin D levels were normally distributed with a mean (SD) value of 11.36 (4.75) ng/mL and median (range) values of 10.85 (3.9-24.9) ng/mL. Majority of babies had values between 5 to 15 ng/mL. This study shows that even in tropical climates most of our neonates are born with deficient vitamin D levels.
