Title: Anaemia in Newly Diagnosed Patients of Rheumatoid Arthritis and its Correlation with Disease Activity

Abstract
Aim: To detect frequency of anemia in patients of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to establish relationship between hemoglobin level and disease activity in RA.

Method: Fifty nine patients of RA fulfilling 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria of RA having disease duration less than two years were included in the study. Haemoglobin (Hb) levels were measured. Disease activity was assessed by DAS-28 score.

Results: Among 40/59 (67.80%) anemic cases, 22/40 (55%) patients had anaemia of chronic disease (ACD), 11/40 (27.50%) patients had Iron deficiency anemia (IDA), 3/40 (7.5%) patients had vitamin B(12) deficiency, 1/40 (2.50%) patient had folate deficiency and 3/40 (7.50%) patients had combined IDA and vitamin B(12) deficiency. Duration of disease, rheumatoid factor positivity and occurrence of erosive disease were not significantly different among anaemic and nonanaemic patients (p>0.05 for each). Mean ESR (p>0.02) and DAS-28 (p>0.001) were statistically significantly different among anaemic and nonanaemic patients. Haemoglobin level had significant negative correlation with disease activity (DAS28) in RA cases (r -0.5533, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Anemia was seen in higher frequency in RA patients. Haemoglobin had significantly negative correlation with disease activity (DAS 28) in RA. .

Conclusion: Anemia was seen in higher frequency in RA patients. Haemoglobin had significantly negative correlation with disease activity (DAS 28) in RA.
