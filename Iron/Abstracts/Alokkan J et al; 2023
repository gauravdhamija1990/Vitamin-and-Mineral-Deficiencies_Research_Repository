Title: Prevalance of Iron Deficiency Anaemia in Laryngopharyngeal Reflux

Abstract
Aim: To determine the correlation of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in patients diagnosed with Laryngo Pharyngeal Reflux Disease (LPRD).

Materials and methods: 100 patients who presented to the OPD, diagnosed to have LPRD based on the Reflux Symptom Index (score > 13) and the Reflux Findings Score (score > 9), were subjected to a Complete Blood count and Peripheral smear examination to look for indices suggestive of an Iron deficiency state or anaemia.

Results: 58% (58) of the patients included in the study had Hb less than 11.5 g/dl with an average Hb of 11 g/dl. 93% (93) had PCV < 40%, and 94% (94) had elevated RDW (> 14.5%). 53% of the patients included had low MCV, MCH, and MCHC. 53% of the patients showed features of microcytic hypochromic RBCs on the peripheral smear. Elevated RDW can be used as an indicator of an iron-deficient state in populations with a high prevalence of IDA, like India.

Conclusion: The study shows a strong correlation between LPRD and an Iron deficient state. However, whether iron deficiency is the cause or effect of LPRD needs to be determined further. Further research in this area could shed light on the pathophysiology of LPRD and have implications for its treatment.
