Title: Hypoferremic State in Overweight and Obese Children

Abstract
Children with high body mass index (BMI) are at risk of iron deficiency. In present study, 71 children with overweight or obesity were screened for iron deficiency. Mean BMI, ferritin and plasma soluble transferrin receptor (sTrfR) levels were 26.1 kg/m2, 41.9 Âµg/L and 0.375 mg/L, respectively. Twenty (28%) children had anemia, and 44 (62%) had an underlying hypoferraemic state.
