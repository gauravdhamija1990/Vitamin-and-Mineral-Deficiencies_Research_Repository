Title: Oral health status of children suffering from thyroid disorders

Abstract
Background: Thyroid dysfunction is the second most common disorder of the endocrine system that can affect any system of the body. The oral cavity can be adversely affected by either an excess or deficiency of these hormones.

Aim of the study: To assess and compare the oral health status of children suffering from thyroid disorders and healthy children.

Materials and methods: A total of 200 children aged between 2 years and 16 years were allocated into two groups. The study group consisted of 100 children with thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism), while the control group consisted of 100 healthy children. Gingival index, plaque index, DMFT (Decayed missing filled teeth Index for permanent teeth) & Dmft index (Decayed missing filled teeth Index for primary teeth) and modified developmental defects of enamel (DDE) index were recorded and data were analyzed statistically.

Results: Plaque and gingival scores were significantly higher in the thyroid group compared to the control group. DMFT and dmft scores were higher in the thyroid group than the control group but the difference in score was not statistically significant. Statistically significant DDE score was found in the thyroid group. Apart from increased susceptibility to caries and poor periodontal health condition, children with thyroid disorders were also found to have other oral manifestations such as macroglossia, open bite, and change in eruption pattern.

Conclusion: Thyroid dysfunction (both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism) has impact on the oral health status. Children with thyroid disorders showed high prevalence of dental caries and periodontal disease compared to the control group.
