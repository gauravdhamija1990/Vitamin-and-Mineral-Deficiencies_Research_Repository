Title: Study of prevalence of iron deficiency of Anemia in School going Children in Rural India

Abstract :

BACKGROUND: Micro nutritional deficiencies are common in developing countries like India. Nutritional deficiency anemia is more prevalent in children and young adolescent male and females. The objective of present study was to determine the prevalence of Iron deficiency anemia in children age group 8-12 years in our locality. AIM: to estimate the prevalence of IDA in Bhojapur, Taluka Sinnar of Maharashtra. METHODS: this Cross Sectional study was conducted in school going children of Bhojapur, Taluka Sinnar of Maharashtra, age group 8-12 year boys and girls. Hemoglobin, Serum Ferritin, Total Iron Binding Capacity [TIBC] and Transferrin levels were analyzed. RESULTS: 185 males and 174 female school going children were examined, IDA was prevalent in 58.9% of males and 63.2 % in females, there was significant decrease in parameters of Hemoglobin, Serum Ferritin and Transferrin saturation and increase in Total Iron Binding Capacity in this group of population indicating prevalence of the Iron deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: within limitations of the present study it was found that Iron deficiency anemia was common in children in rural India. IDA was slightly more prevalent in girls of the same age group as compared to boys. Lower socioeconomic status was linked with decreased Hemoglobin levels probably due to nutritional deficiencies. This calls for a comprehensive micro nutritional policy in addition to food security to address the problem
