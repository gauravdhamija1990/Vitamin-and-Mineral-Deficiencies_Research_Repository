Title: Severe Thrombocytopenia in Dengue Fever and Vitamin B12 Level

Abstract
Objective: To document correlation between vitamin B12 deficiency and severity of thrombocytopenia, platelate recovery and duration of hospital stay in dengue fever patients.

Methods: This prospective observationl study was done in dengue fever patient with severe prolonged thrombocytopenia (<20,000 µl and > 2 days duration). Patient with underlying malignancy, hematological disorders, septicemia, or use of any drug which may cause thrombocytopenia, were excluded. Standard statistical methods were used.

Results: Total 40 subjects were included in current study. Twenty one were male and mean age was 25±12 years. Forty percent sujects were having B12 level < 200 pg/L and mean B12 level was 336.9±362.36 pg/L. SDP requirement was highest in B12<100 pg/L group was (3±1.41) as compmared to other groups Time required for recovery of platelates to 20000/µl thresold, was also highest in B12<100 pg/L group (5.75±0.95days) as compmared to other groups. Duration of hospital stay was also highest in B12<100 pg/L group (5.25±1.25days) as compmared to other groups. There was no relation between B12 levels and other complications of dengue like bleeding, serositis, and shock.

Conclusion: Our study suggests that B12 deficiency may responsible for severe thrombocytopenia; slower platelates count recovery and prolonged hospitalisation in dengue fever patients.
