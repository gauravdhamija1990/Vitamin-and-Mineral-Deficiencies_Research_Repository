Efficacy of maternal vitamin B12 supplementation for improving infant outcomes in settings with high deficiency

Maternal vitamin B12 supplementation to improve early neurodevelopment in infants has been proposed for some time now because vitamin B12 is a neurotropic vitamin, and infant neurodevelopment and growth are important dimensions for attained human capital and a healthy and successful adult life. In The Lancet, Ram K Chandyo and colleagues 1 report a community-based, double-blind, randomised controlled trial in a Nepalese region, which is endemic for biochemical vitamin B12 deficiency. Chandyo and colleagues 1 evaluated the effect of daily maternal vitamin B12 supplementation (50 μg per day) from early pregnancy until 6 months post partum on infant growth and neurodevelopment. The authors deserve compliments for their large and rigorous efficacy trial, which included 800 pregnant women, with 400 (50%) women randomly assigned to receive vitamin B12 supplementation and 400 (50%) women randomly assigned to the placebo group (mean age was 27·7 years [SD 4·0]). At baseline, 569 (71%) of the women had plasma vitamin B12 concentrations indicating low or marginal status (<221 pmol/L). The primary outcomes were length-for-age Z-scores (LAZ) at age 12 months, and the cognitive composite score of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (Bayley-III) at age 6 months and 12 months. In this trial, there was no improvement in infant growth or neurodevelopment associated with vitamin B12 supplementation. The mean LAZ score at age 12 months was –0·57 (SD 1·03) in the vitamin B12 group and –0·55 (1·03) in the placebo group with a mean difference of –0·02 (95% CI –0·16 to 0·13). The mean cognitive composite scores (ie, at age 6 and 12 months) were 97·7 (SD 10·5) in the vitamin B12 group and 97·1 (10·2) in the placebo group, with a mean difference of 0·5 (–0·6 to 1·7). There was also no significant difference in infant haemoglobin concentrations despite a substantial biomarker response and improved vitamin B12 status among mothers and infants.
