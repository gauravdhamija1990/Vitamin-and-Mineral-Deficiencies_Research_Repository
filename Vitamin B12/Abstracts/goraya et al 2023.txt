Epileptic Spasms During Recovery From Nutritional Infantile Vitamin B12 Deficiency

Abstract
Development of epileptic spasms in infants with vitamin B12 deficiency is uncommon. In some cases, infants presenting with epileptic spasms have been found to have concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency. Treatment with vitamin B12 and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) resulted in resolution of epileptic spasms. In others, epileptic spasms have developed during recovery from vitamin B12 deficiency. Treatment with ACTH or other seizure medications resulted in resolution of epileptic spasms, although response has been less predictable. We describe three infants who initially presented with clinical and laboratory features of vitamin B12 deficiency. Treatment with vitamin B12 resulted in rapid resolution of symptoms. However, recovery was interrupted by the development of epileptic spasms. All infants showed hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalography. Treatment with prednisolone, with or without other antiseizure medications, resulted in slow resolution of spasms. Cognitive and language delays were noted in two infants. Epileptic spasms may supervene during recovery from vitamin B12 deficiency affecting outcomes.
