Introduction
Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are likely to have poor nutritional intake and increased gut losses. This study was designed to study the prevalence and predictors of nutritional deficiencies in patients with UC and their impact on the quality of life (QOL).

Methods
A prospective study was conducted among consenting patients with UC (cases) and healthy relatives of the cases (controls) visiting a university teaching hospital. They were assessed for clinical, demographic, endoscopic (Mayo score) and histological profile (Robart’s score). They were assessed for the presence of macronutrient and micronutrient deficiency, anthropometry, functional status (muscle strength by dynamometer and sit-to-stand test) and the quality of life (short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire [SIBDQ]). A SIBDQ score of ≤ 50 was considered poor QOL.

Results
We studied 126 cases and 57 healthy controls (age [mean ± SD] 37.7 ± 13.2 years vs. 34.40 ± 11.05 years; [p = 0.10] females [38.1% vs. 38.7%]; p = 0.94). Cases more often were underweight (28% vs. 3.5%; p < 0.001), had low mid arm circumference (45% vs. 12%; p < 0.0001), lower functional status in the form of weaker hand grip strength (67% vs. 45.6%; p = 0.007) and weaker lower limb strength (80% vs. 42%; p < 0.0001). Cases more often had the evidence of macronutrient deficiencies: total serum protein deficiency (31% vs. 3.5%; p < 0.0001), serum albumin deficiency (25.4% vs. 0.00%; p < 0.0001) and cholesterol deficiency (63% vs. 28%; p < 0.0001). Micronutrient deficiencies were highly prevalent among cases: calcium (44%), phosphate (21%), magnesium (11%), zinc (76%), iron (87%), folate (16%), vitamin B12 (10%) and vitamin D (81%). Most cases had a poor quality of life (85/126; 67.5%). Factors associated with poor QOL were low hemoglobin, serum albumin, zinc and vitamin D levels and histologically active disease. On multi-variate analysis, low vitamin D levels (odds ratio [OR] = 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9–19.7) and histologically active disease (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.6–9.9) were identified as independent predictors of poor QOL.

Conclusions
Macronutrient deficiency, micronutrient deficiency, lower functional status and poorer QOL are highly prevalent among patients with UC. The independent predictors of poor QOL were histologically active disease and low serum vitamin D levels. Identifying and correcting the deficiencies may help in improving the QOL of patients with UC.
